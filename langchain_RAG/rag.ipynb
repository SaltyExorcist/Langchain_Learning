      "it is truly wonderful to see you where are we we're in central London we've come to Mayfair now we are going to a very very special Indian restaurant I went to verish Swami now it's got one Michelin star and loads of you turned around and said Gary there's a better one I was thinking wow there can't be a better one is there gave me a recommendation what is it Jim Cara now it specializes in Northern Indian food and it hasn't got one it's got two to michelan Stars so it's got to be seriously up there you asked me to go here quite a while ago it's Tak me ages to get a booking 3 months waiting list so if you're ever interested in coming here you're going to have to be a bit patient can't wait for it as always got to be careful here let's give it a go kind it has to be very patient the road is suddenly become padilly circus not Mayfair I won't pass go and I won't collect 200 come on look at the menu outside it's certainly not for the Fain hearted I'm going to give you one simple example here oh dear me where are be game chops you know I like my lamb chops lamb chops uh 66 let's go [Music] [Music] oh my good God it is stunning in here it is truly truly stunning you walk through you're greeted at the door beautiful restaurant there a bar at the end and you come downstairs which I've come to because I want to try and get in I've got in early and I don't want to be disturbing other customers because they're coming in spending this kind of money they don't want Gary yapping away in the background but it's beautiful area down here it's got a bar as well and a private dining area all in all I'm like absolutely stunned it is beautiful truly beautiful this menu it is a tight tight menu um and you'd expect that under naster I'm going to go for the pan of py now what you do here you hollow out then you put the different sources in you put it into your mouth and hopefully it' be an explosion of flavors and that's 12250 I'm very sad very sad I'm looking down lamb shank Rogan Josh I'm get keep getting told off for having lamb okay I won't have it pressure youve put me under pressure um I'm going to go for the Goen prawn Curry that's £33 really interested to see what that looks like and their specialty here a real speciality is their chicken butter masala that's 33 with that I'm going to get a selection of Breads and uh I'm going to get a rice as well uh the Bread Basket IS250 and the rice is £7 all in all wow wow this is just levels levels above uh any Indian restaurant I ever been in my life it is truly truly stunning staff bang super attentive so yeah really interested to see what it all comes comes out like I've never ever in my life being to a two- rated michelan Star restaurant ever I have I have been to one rated but uh that's HS and ver schami but golly gosh is it going to be really pretentious this hope not you know I feel very relaxed in here so I can't see W Hell by the way I just want to show you something here as well they do do a lunch menu now this comes in a lot cheaper this is £60 and again if you take a look I'm not going to run through it all so again if you if you're thinking well I want to experience it but I don't want to actually spend huge money just take a look lunch menu yeah and it's a quite an extensive Lun Munch Munch Munch lunch Munch menu so um yeah interesting I'll see you when my starter [Music] arrives an explosion I hope so anyway pany here we go take a look here so you got chickpeas and Tamarind and various spices in there this is very simple what you do you pick one up okay first part done no problem at all then you create this is going to be it a little Hollow maybe a bit bit more than that because uh I'm going to struggle otherwise pick this up I'm very sorry about doing that fill it up that's in there now this is a bit spicy so what you do or what I'm going to do it's going to St nice and gentle so you pour that in let's not go mad let's not going mad first time put that there and then in one so it's not like a bite in one oh my god bang no other word for it that was an explosion of flavor so you have the chickpea then you have some spices in there but the overriding flavor to start with is tamarind I'm getting excited I'm moving this over then this guy comes into play and that gives you a real kick so it's balancing the flavors so you get this flavor first and then when you actually having it all going around the mouth it's just suddenly a major explosion of flavors I've never I've never experienced that before seriously I'm just I'm like forget it I've got to go in again don't ruin this Gary just cuz you're excited once again sorry this going to be on repeat for a little bit but this time a little bit more heat so put you in there oh see see Gary has to ruin it by getting too excited and creating a big hole in the bottom I can't let it go to waste so this one go down so and then I'll do the last one with lots of spice even though I put loads of spice in there that's not the overriding flavor doesn't kill everything although my mouth is tingling away as a starter one is a bit of theater but two is the flavor the flavors are incredible and that is coming from these chickpeas and The Tamarind that's the overriding flavor and that is a nice little bit of heat to go on top as a starter that's incredible that has really got me excited and yeah what can I say the only thing I can say is I'm going to finish enjoy the other thing about it as well it's quite a light starter so that really helps so again with um Curry it can be a little bit too heavy but this well very very long ping pong balls edible ping pong balls okay I shall see you very soon great starter [Music] [Music] here we go I'm actually really excited this my prawn going Curry oh wow wow wow the aroma wow wow wow wow wow wow then so I give that a bit of stir so you can actually see oh Cy look at these prawns lovely then the chicken butter masala now this is their signature dish this is what everyone goes for I've got to be very careful here very careful cuz I do not want to spill a single drop at these prices bread baskets over here so you have the coriander one you got some plain Nar and that's a oh that's a stuffed one and Gary stuffs it all up as well I'm going to do let's get the plane plates are lovely and warm the Nan equally so I'm just going to get in here and I want to try this sauce as I say this is their signature so this is the one everyone goes mad about I'm going to say the obious is there it's buttery it's creamy but it has a little little bit of heat a little bit of kick but I've um wow I don't know how they make that in that kitchen with that sauce no I can't judge it on one so let's pick it up let's have a bit of chicken on the plate a bit of chicken GES let's put that there lots of this sauce this can't got to waste on there I want to try that with some of the rice get that there let's try try it with just a little bit of rice so give myself in a bit of a kafuffle here it's cut into the chicken to say that chicken is tender pulls away his understatement it's just come on let's get with it in there in there that's chicken thigh and what I like the chicken thigh that has got so much flavor so again you have the lights the chicken breast and again that's very tasty but the thigh is where all the flavor in a chicken is the meat itself the chicken is super tender that is elevated to a level way above any butter chicken curry I've ever had butter chicken masala Curry I've ever had it is so incredible I was going to say intense but it isn't the intense it's incredible it's incredible cooking yeah the sheen to it as well I mean come if you take a look at this look at that for a Sheen it's just inviting and obviously you got herbs in there as well on top I keep I keep actually ping away and getting more and more without tasting it which is madness that goes down as one of the best what is so clever it does catch you and it kind of Fades away not mad about your spice do let them know cuz there is that kick it's not unpleasant please don't think that but it does catch you and that caught me just in I was I say that I'm bit of a spice wuss as well so would I say that is incredible and I'm I'm really sorry to say but it is totally incredible um yeah I can understand why it's a signature dish what I want to do is get in finish this clear the plate and in fact what I'm going to do is get another plate a complete new plate and I want to try the prawns Goen prawn Curry I'll see you very very soon brilliant nor brilliant nor it starts to get very busy here and some people have joined us next on the table next to us lovely people I've got to say really nice but I don't want to disturb them at all so take a look here as you've seen before now what the chat has said to me this should be a little bit sour a little bit of heat with it as in spice and he said the prawns should just melt let's get plenty of the sauce that sauce is a lot thinner so this one's quite a dense sauce this one here is a lot thinner they're quite similar in color but i' imagine totally different in flavor and taste so let's cut in and see what we think I want to get plenty of this sauce there that's exactly as he said sauce is a little bit on a little bit s not sour that sounds wrong it's got a slight sourness and then a heat creaminess as well to it and it's got a a hint there's no doubt there's fish stock in there as well so there's nice amount of fish stock the prawns are CRS I've only have one Sensational that that's a taste of the ocean I've never been to goer I'm going to go to go cuz if that's what it's all about yeah you taste Tamarind in there and I understand hello there I hope you enjing your lunch I can tell you this is absolutely fabulous thank you so the chef has just come out to say hello here I got to say this is some incredible cooking so thank you very very much Chef thank you thank you he's going around to the tables just making sure everything's good good what a touch that is a fantastic touch just for the chef to come out so as I said one of Rick Stein's U most favorite dishes but I'm not taking any notice of Rick at the moment because me and him are not mates I'm I'm not sending him a Christmas card that's for sure but I want to try it with this naan with coriander in it let's just see have I made a good have I made a good call or good choice or should I've actually gone with just a plane I definitely made a good call getting the king pra Curry there's no doubts about that if you take a look there's so much fresh coriander in that Mom what do I think I think I'm very lucky I am I'm very lucky because this is a super high-end treat and I won't get the privilege of coming here very often I imagine quite a few people would struggle coming here but as an experience wow I am um is it the simple thing ver schami was up there and it was fantastic is that a level above you're going to have to wait I will tell you shortly but wow wow wow wow and wow see you soon here we have the mea desserts taking a look look through you take a look through it yourself what I've I going for I'm looking here I'm going to go for their um basically I'm going to go for the Indian rice pudding I'll explain it all soon it's got figs in there yeah just about everything and that's £10 and here it is right on Q if I can leave that over there look at this for presentation now I picked that up earlier on and look I managed to break it already because it is so delicate moving that and I've done it again take a look in here so you have figs in there obviously the rice and this is ice cream in the middle as well well this is certainly a different take isn't it on rice pudding I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to move that over there and move this right in front of me break every etiquette in the whole book [Music] it's not like any rice pudding I've ever had and taste the figs there then it's got some some spices around it not as in hot spices but spices that is one of the most Pleasant my SPS overhead I sitting here thinking will this bring me back my school days and all the rest of it having rice pudding no I've never had anything like this before try it with some of the ice cream but I want you take a look so you obviously see whole figs in there it's all the spilling of it that's very rich also taste some there's some pistach pistachio nuts in there as well that is just something trying to tell what it is it's super add now I'm going to get the bill give my final thoughts outside was that a good call it was a good call I was thinking I'm not going to get a deser I am or I am I have and just finishes the meal just finishes it off finishes off a truly wonderful not meal experience a fantastic experience see outside Jim carner one of the most expensive and one of the best Indian restaurants in the world I can confirm both I love the inside I love the service I like the ambience everything on there was top draw the food wow wow wow wow seriously that food was truly incredible every mouthful every every aspect of it you put it in it had the flavor oh it it was brilliant cameraman he loved it as well so both of us thought that was great onto the bill starter 12250 uh that butter masala £32 the prawn Curry £ 33b Bread Basket 12250 uh the rice £7 and the dessert uh £10 service charge in there uh 15% 12 £ 3£ 123 that's mindblowing In fairness I did order a lot there there enough for two people but that's still an awful lot of money but then again I am looking at quality would I come here all the time you know would I come here all the time no no there's no chance but would is it somewhere you would go for that really special occasion yeah enough food for two people you got to remember that the other thing which I've got to tell you if I'm actually coming back the one thing I would look at is their set menu because obviously the portions are exactly the same size and I think that's actual better way to go if you're going in there lunchtime evening time yeah I try and mix up the price points on the channel so yeah I I'll go and do fish and chips three pound and I'll go to michan Star restaurants as well and I do prices in between I try and really mix it up and I want to try and showcase certain places that In fairness you know I've never been here before and ibly won't come here maybe ever again but that's an experience an experience that if you get the opportunity definitely definitely give it a go certainly at the high end I'm not silly it's really at the high end what marks I'm going to give it loads of you recommended fantastic recommendation it's quality that's the thing that's the standout quality in every aspect every aspect I'm going to give it a 10 out of 10 I've got to give it a 10 out of 10 because each dish that I had there was amongst the best if not the best I've ever had in any Indian restaurant ever and I love the whole experience if you recommended Jim carner I want to thank you personally thank you very very much if you've been here please tell me what you think if you can like And subscribe to the channel you know I always appreciate that and until next time very lucky person and I recognize that bye-bye that was a brilliant recommendation w\n"
